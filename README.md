# Tracking_and_counting_coordinatess_objectSizes_with_yolov8
Detecting objecta and counting, drawing coordinates of objects and sizes.


This above code that demonstrates how to perform video object tracking and annotate the bounding boxes with coordinates and sizes. The annotated frames are then written to a target video file.

Features
-Object tracking: The code utilizes the BYTETracker algorithm/library for object tracking in video frames.
-Bounding box annotation: The code draws bounding boxes around the tracked objects and writes the coordinates and sizes of the boxes on each frame.
-Target video creation: The annotated frames are written to a target video file for further analysis or visualization.
-Using YOLOv8
