# Tracking_and_counting_coordinatess_objectSizes_with_yolov8



1.How to perform video object tracking and annotate the bounding boxes with coordinates and sizes. The annotated frames are then written to a target video file.

Features

-Object tracking: The code utilizes the BYTETracker algorithm/library for object tracking in video frames.
-Bounding box annotation: The code draws bounding boxes around the tracked objects and writes the coordinates and sizes of the boxes on each frame.
-Target video creation: The annotated frames are written to a target video file for further analysis or visualization.
-Using YOLOv8
